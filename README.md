Machine Learning Analysis with CRISP-DM

Overview

This project applies the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology to analyze the Auto.csv dataset. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and implementation of both supervised and unsupervised learning models.
